# A tinder with Chuck Norris

The application is quite easy to use and was created for academic purposes since it was an 
assignment in a course on Flutter.

If you are seeking amusement by reading humorous anecdotes, then you have come to the appropriate 
location. The central character in this application is Chuck Norris, about whom individuals tell 
tales of legendary proportions, which are available through the https://api.chucknorris.io/ website.

The application retrieves a joke at random, thereby providing users with the best experience. 
The following features have been incorporated thus far:

* Users can swipe left or right to navigate between jokes.
* Users have two options for indicating that they like a joke: they can either click on the 
  favorite icon located at the top-left corner or double-tap on the joke. In the latter case, 
  the heart icon appears for a duration of 500 ms, similar to the behavior of Instagram.
* To undo a like, simply tap on the favorite icon located at the top-left corner. 
  This will reset the like icon.
* When a joke is still in the process of downloading, a loading circle will be displayed to 
  indicate that the operation is ongoing.
* Liked or favorite jokes are stored locally, enabling users to access them at any time without 
  an internet connection.
* Users can perform a search for jokes that contain specific characters provided by the user.
